### Making it easier than ever to waste time on r/photoshopbattles


**ReadMeEditor** is a react app which grabs r/photoshopbattles posts and respective posts' first level comments which more often than not contain photoshopped original post's image.
This project is as finished as it'll ever be, some of possible improvements would be dynamic post loading (currently has hardcoded max number of posts and comments, current limit is set relatively low cca. 50 in order to make web app faster, but it can be easily changed), comment card image could lead to reddit.com comments (can be easily done, but couldn't have been bothered.)
If you are interested how app looks, you can find a screenshot under `installation` subsection.
